## What's in the package?

***.gitignore***

***.Rbuildignore*** list of files that need but won't be included when we build the package from source

***DESCRIPTION*** provides the metadata for the package - we'll edit this

***NAMESPACE*** will automatically change as we change the package

***R*** "The business end of the package", where all the functions live

## Connecting to Github

Then get the github dowloaded and connected to your R by following the internets instructions and terminal...

```{r tell r to use git, include=FALSE}
library(devtools)
use_git()
```
